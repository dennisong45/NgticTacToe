# TicXO

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Readme ( What i learned etc)

Alot of reference and googling and copy and pasting. Main core is that I want to dwell into Angular and Firebase.

Angular have three main components.

Mainly is adding components.
Secondary is importing modules.
Thirdly is after everything code is done you can NgBuild to turn typescript into Javascript and turn into web-app.
Next, is using firebase to deploy my web-app
Lastly, using webpack able to package and install offline into your computer, or repackage to iOS or android.
